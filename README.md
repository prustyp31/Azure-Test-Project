# Azure-Test-Project
This Project is created for Azure Infra with CI-CD Pipeline 
I will be creating a  simple Node.js web app, build it in CI, run tests and scans, build a Docker image, push to Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploy automatically to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster (with an alternate simpler path to Azure App Service).
